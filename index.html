          My name is Thomas Johannessen, I'm born 1981, originally from
          Gildeskål up north in Norway, I live
          with my girlfriend and our two fantastic daughters (aged 4.5 and 1
          years old) in Etterstad, Oslo. My friends say I'm creative, funny
          and smart. And I think my employers would say that I'm trustworthy,
          loyal and hard-working. My interests outside work and family is quite
          complex board games (not Monopoly or Risk. If you know names like
          Martin Wallace, Vital Lacerda, Reiner Knizia and Matt Eklund we can
          talk about it later, if not I'll spare you the details) and working
          out. I'm also interested in cooking, history and keeping up to date with
          current events. For example I followed a 25 hour Yale univeristy 
          video course on Ukrainian history last year.

          Actually I've tried this path before - barely. I studied programming more 
          than 20 years ago, back when "tablets" were actual stone tablets, but dropped
          out during the second semester to work. I instead studied
          physiotherapy, which I completed and got my degree in 2006. However, I
          never actually got to work as a physio, instead I opted into the world
          of easier money (I thought at the time, it didn't turn out to be quite
          that simple, although I'we done well over the years) working as a
          Personal Trainer in Sandvika, Bærum.

          This all coincided with me pushing for a career in sports, I had trained
          full contact kickboxing a few years and eventually found Brazilian Jiu
          Jitsu back in 2003 in Trondheim during my studies. I've always done
          sports - football, cross country skiing, swimming and weight lifting,
          but never really been any good at it. I found that I had some talent
          for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (from hereon BJJ, which I realize is a bit of
          an unfortunate abbreviation). Moving to Oslo I started training at
          Frontline Academy, the leading academy in Norway for MMA, BJJ and Muay
          Thai. Working as a PT was a perfect combination for years of hard
          training, travelling and competing, so I stuck with my work at what
          was then called Elixia, now SATS.

          I eventually graduated to black belt after winning consecutive medals
          at brown belt in the European Championship as well as Pan-American
          Open in 2013, Rome Open and Swedish Open. As a black belt I won Nordic
          Open, Swedish Open, Rome Open, 2x London Open and double gold in Nice
          Open. I also instructed quite a bit, and travelled around doing seminars. 
          Unfortunately I've been forced to retire from competition after a couple 
          of bad neck and knee injuries with surgeries (nothing that bothers me daily,
          it's just not compatible with full contact competitive martial arts).
          Nowadays I still work out almost every day, but more weight lifting,
          running and bike riding (yup I'm one of them, sorry not sorry). The last few
          years I've also  settled down and started a family, we had our first daughter
          back in 2018, which is a fantastic but different sort of challenge.

          Now we arrive at why you're (maybe, hopefully, I don't know) still reading
          this: Challenge is the keyword. I need a new one. The last few years
          I've in addition to my job as a Personal Trainer also had an
          administrative part time position at Frontline Academy (we're two
          people sharing the manager position, and been doing that 4 years),
          during the pandemic both my employers had to shut down shop more or
          less the whole time. During that time I was working for Oslo Kommune
          with COVID-19 vaccination, due to my background from physiotherapy. I
          realize that working more than 15 years for Elixia/SATS has become a
          bit stale for me, and if I'm going to do something else - now is the
          time, we're done producing kids and I'm motivated to do something
          else.

          So I started coding, back in mid December 2022. And stuck with it, a
          couple hours a day since then. Every. single. day. I started out with 
          some Python, but since I have many friends who are real full time
          professional developers I soon started to get helpful tips. This lead me
          into JavScript, CSS and HTML in January. I've done the big Jonas
          Schmedtmann Udemy-course (The Complete JavaScript Course: From Zero to
          Expert!) as well as many small projects on my own, the Wes Bos "30
          JavaScript challenges in 30 days" course etc. One tip I took to heart was
          to not get stuck in "tutorial hell", so I've always tried to have a small
          code project going on side of the course, also always trying to come up with
          my own solution to the problem before watching the tutorial. So far I've focused on 
          modern vanilla JavaScript in tandem with HTML and CSS. 
          Do I think I'm ready to become a fulltime coder already? Absolutely not, as a 
          matter of fact I think you'd be completely mad to hire me. However, I've sent 
          some projects to my developer friends who say that I absolutely should start applying 
          for junior developer positions already. So that's why I do this. At first
          I thought they were just being nice, but they insist that they're
          serious. I have good people skills, I pick up on things pretty easily,
          I've also got a black belt in googling, I'm motivated and I think I
          can become good at this with some guidance and the right employer.
        </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Edit September 2023: </strong> Done several more vanilla JS projects,
         now doing the big Jonas Schmedtmann React course on Udemy (and of course side projects to practice).
         Now I'm thinking you'll be slightly less mad to hire me. The rest of the text still applies.</p>
